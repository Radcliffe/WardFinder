Minneapolis Ward Finder
=======================

##What does it do?##

This is a Python 2.7 script that accepts a list of Minneapolis street addresses
and looks up the ward for each address.

##How do I use it?##

The syntax is as follows:

`python wards.py inputfile outputfile delay`

where *inputfile* is a text file containing a list of street addresses,
one address per line; and *outputfile* is the output file, which will 
contain the street address and the ward, separated by a comma.

##Installation and requirements##

This script requires Python 2.7 and the lxml library.
